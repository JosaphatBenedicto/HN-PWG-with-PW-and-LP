# HN-PWG-with-PW-and-LP
GitHub Repository for the Undergraduate Project entitled "Filipino Speech Synthesis Using a Harmonic-plus-Noise Network with Linear Prediction and Perceptual Weighting Filters" authored by Josaphat Ira Emmanuel P. Benedicto, Johanna Lindsey C. Pasco, and Camille Marie H. Tatoy and advised by Crisron Rudolf G. Lucas, M.S. EE

## Source Code
+ Tacotron2 by izzajalandoni ([@izzajalandoni](https://github.com/izzajalandoni))
+ Parallel WaveGAN (PWG) by Tomoki Hayashi ([@kan-bayashi](https://github.com/kan-bayashi))
+ Harmonic-plus-Noise (H+N) by Reo YONEYAMA ([@chomeyama](https://github.com/chomeyama))

## Modifications
+ Tacotron2
  - N/A
+ PWG
  - Filipino Dataset is used, ISIP Corpora
+ H+N PWG
  - FIlipino Dataset is used, ISIP Corpora
  - sampling frequency set to 16kHz
+ H+N PWG with Linear Prediction (LP) Filter Network
  - From the original code of H+N, the py files in folder "HN-PWG-LP" are modified


## Sample Files
Sample files are provided for each model with wav files under 3 categories: sentence, number, and place

## Database
